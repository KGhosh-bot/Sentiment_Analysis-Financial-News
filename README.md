In recent years NLP has become increasingly important and an essential business tool for finding insights from data from social media channels.
Sentiment analysis finds its best usage in analyzing the language used in social media posts, responses reviews, attitudes, and emotions towards products, promotions, and ads of companies.

Sentiment analysis of large volumes of text data such as emails, and reviews can help to automatically determine the author’s attitude towards the topic which can be used by companies to improve customer service and increase the reputation of their brand.

Sentiment analysis attempts to extract subjective qualities—attitudes, emotions, sarcasm, confusion, suspicion—from the text. Accurate and timely
information about financial news is an important area for sentiment analysis. The ability to learn complex patterns and relationships in large datasets made convolutional neural networks (CNNs) a powerful tool for sentiment analysis.
